    "# API Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a high level overview of major abstractions and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets contain a set of feature vectors and optionally a set of corresponding label vectors. Label vectors should be integer values that will be used for indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = ArrayDataset(my_features, my_labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets support sampling features with and without labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sample_features = data.sample(500)\n",
    "sample_features, sample_labels = data.sample_with_label(500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets also allow for creating sub-samples which returns another `ArrayDataset` object with the desired number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data_subsample = data.subsample(1000, equal_classes=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance functions subclass `DistanceFunction`. The purpose of this class is to generate a cost matrix. Custom methods should overwrite the `__call__` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class CustomDistance(DistanceFunction):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def __call__(self, x_vals, y_vals=None, mask_diagonal=False):\n",
    "        return my_cost_metric(x_vals, y_vals)\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `mask_diagonal` is True, the diagonal of the cost matrix will be masked with large values. This allows for commputing transport plans within a dataset rather than between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance functions support computing transport distances using the Gaussian approximation of the p-Wasserstein distance (see the [Algorithms](https://github.com/kheyer/OTDD/blob/main/Algorithms/Optimal%20Transport.ipynb) notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gaussian_transport_distance = DistanceFunction.gaussian_distance(x,y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this function is not implemented in the base `DistanceFunction` since the standard Gaussian approximation assumed a Euclidean distance metric, which might not always be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost functions subclass `CostFunction`. This class uses a given `DistanceFunction` to solve a transport problem between two datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal Transport Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the optimal transport between two sets of feature vectors is done in two steps.\n",
    "1. Compute pairwise distances between elements in each dataset to generate a cost matrix\n",
    "2. Use an optimal transport cost function to calculate optimal coupling between data items\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distance` function returns the transport cost, coupling matrix and ground cost matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "distance_function = POTDistance(distance_metric='euclidean')\n",
    "cost_function = SinkhornCost(distance_function, entropy=0.2)\n",
    "cost, coupling, M_dist = cost_function.distance(x_vals, y_vals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`cost` is the transport cost between datasets. `coupling` is the coupling matrix solved by the `cost_function` and `M_dist` is the distnce matrix calculated by `distance_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal Transport Dataset Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distance_with_labels` function calculates the transport cost using the OTDD algorithm from [Geometric Dataset Distances via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02923.pdf). Label distnces are calculated by computing the optimal transport cost between label subsets of each dataset. Then the full transport problem is solved with the label augmented cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_{Z}\\bigl((x,y), (x',y') \\bigr) \\triangleq \\bigl( d_{X}(x,x')^p  %2B \\text{W}_p^p(\\alpha_y, \\alpha_{y'}) \\bigr)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the OTDD distance between two datasets:\n",
    "1. Compute pairwise distances between elements in each dataset to generate a cost matrix\n",
    "2. Compute label-to-label optimal transport distances\n",
    "3. Update the cost matrix with label distances\n",
    "4. Use an optimal transport cost function to calculate optimal coupling between data items\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cost, coupling, OTDD_matrix, class_distances, class_x_dict, class_y_dict = cost_function.distance_with_labels(x_vals, y_vals, x_labels, y_label)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`cost` is the OTDD transport cost between datasets. `coupling` is the coupling matrix solved by the `cost_function` and `OTDD_matrix` is the distnce matrix calculated by `distance_function` with label-to-label distances. `class_distances` is the matrix of label-to-label distances between datasets. `class_x_dict` and `class_y_dict` map label values in `x_labels` and `y_labels` to index values in `class_distances`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "For large datasets, computing the optimal transport cost can be prohibative. The transport cost can be approximated by a closed form solution for the 2-Wasserstein distance between two Gaussians, also called the Fr√©chet distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\text{W}_2^2(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\| \\mu_{\\alpha} - \\mu_{\\beta} \\|_2^2 %2B  \\| \\Sigma^\\frac{1}{2}_\\alpha - \\Sigma_{\\beta}^\\frac{1}{2} \\|_{F}^2\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the derivation for this equation assumed a Euclidean cost metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Gaussian approximation distance between two datasets (ie no labels):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cost = distance_function.gaussian_distance(x_vals, y_vals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the transport distance with labels, there are two approaches. One is to calculte the label-to-label distances with the Gaussian approximation, then solve the optimal transport coupling between the two datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cost, coupling, OTDD_matrix, class_distances, class_x_dict, class_y_dict = cost_function.distance_with_labels(x_vals, y_vals, x_labels, y_label, gaussian_class_distance=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An even quicker approach is to calculate the transport cost using the class distance matrix, solving the optimal transport problem over a `c1 x c2` space rather than a `n1 x n2` space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cost, coupling, OTDD_matrix, class_distances, class_x_dict, class_y_dict = cost_function.distance_with_labels(x_vals, y_vals, x_labels, y_label, gaussian_class_distance=True, gaussian_data_distance=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to reducing the compute for calculating transport costs is to calculate the transport cost between bootstrapped samples from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bootstrapping standard transport:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "distances = cost_function.bootstrap_distance(num_iterations, dataset_x, sample_size_x, \n",
    "                                      dataset_y, sample_size_y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For bootstrapping transport with labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "distances = cost_function.bootstrap_label_distance(num_iterations, dataset_x, sample_size_x, \n",
    "                                      dataset_y, sample_size_y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Gaussian approximations under-estimate the transport cost, while bootstrapping over-estimates the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intra-Dataset Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the intra-dataset distance (ie $W_{p}^{p}(\\alpha, \\alpha)$), pass the `mask_diagonal=True` to the distance methods. The diagonal of the cost matrix (self-distance) will be masked with a large value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in `plot.py` provide several plotting approaches using [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), [HoloViews](https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews) and [Datashader](https://github.com/holoviz/datashader). Datashader methods are recomended for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with MNIST and USPS digit datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mnist = ArrayDataset(mnist_vecs, labels=mnist_labels)\n",
    "usps = ArrayDataset(usps_vecs, labels=usps_labels)\n",

    "                                      gaussian_class_distance=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "cost, coupling, OTDD_matrix, class_distances, class_x_dict, class_y_dict = outputs\n",
